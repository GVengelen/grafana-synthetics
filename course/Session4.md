# Session 4: Performance Monitoring and Metrics

## Core Performance Metrics and Their Significance
Response time, latency, error rate, availability, and throughput.

## Setting Up Performance Benchmarks
Define SLAs/SLOs for your endpoints and user journeys. Use k6 thresholds and Grafana dashboards.

## Geographic Distribution of Checks
Configure checks to run from multiple locations in Grafana Cloud for global coverage.

## Hands-On: Performance Measurement Implementation
Update your scripts to include custom metrics. Visualize results in Grafana dashboards.

## Q&A and Troubleshooting Session
Review common issues (authentication, network, script errors). Use Grafana Cloud logs and dashboards for debugging.
